      "about": "The Hyundai IPO could be the largest in Indian history! /n Hyundai Motor India, a subsidiary of the Korea-based Hyundai Group, was established in 1996. The company specializes in manufacturing and selling a wide range of four-wheeler passenger vehicles, including sedans, hatchbacks, SUVs, and electric vehicles (EVs). Additionally, Hyundai produces key automotive parts such as transmissions and engines. /n Currently, Hyundai\u2019s lineup includes 13 models, ranging from sedans and hatchbacks to SUVs. In FY 2024, Hyundai captured approximately 15% of the domestic car market, securing the second position behind Maruti Suzuki. As of December 31, 2023, Hyundai Motor India boasted 1,366 sales outlets and 1,550 service centres across various cities and towns in India. This marked a significant expansion from March 31, 2021, when the company operated 1,167 sales outlets and 1,307 service centres. /n 4 million! That\u2019s how many cars Indians bought in 2023. In fact, we\u2019re the third-biggest car market globally, trailing only China and the US. With electric vehicles gaining popularity, experts predict India will have 2.5 million EVs on the roads by 2025, making us the third-largest EV market as well. Automakers are closely watching these developments and are eager to jump on this trend. /n Take Hyundai India, for instance. Despite being a subsidiary of South Korea\u2019s Hyundai Motor Company, it has a rich history in the country. Hyundai India became a household name by manufacturing locally, overcoming early competition, and innovating for the Indian market. Now, they plan to take it further by raising a whopping \u20b925,000 crores through an IPO, potentially breaking previous IPO records held by LIC and PayTM. /n But wait\u2026 If Hyundai is a foreign brand, why pursue an IPO in the Indian market, you ask?",
